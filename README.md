# Rainfall-Weather-Forecasting
Project Goal: Develop machine learning models for weather forecasting in Australia using historical data. Tasks include binary classification for rain prediction (Yes/No) and regression for estimating rainfall amounts (in mm) on the following day. The aim is to enhance accuracy and reliability in weather predictions for various applications.
